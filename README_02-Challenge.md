# <HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor>

## Description

Refactor HTML and CSS coding to improve functionality and presentation. Be able to push refactored data to GitHub. This helped me develop the following summary of the pull/push process:

    1. Change to working directory
    2. — ls
    3. — git status
    4. — git checkout -b feature/*
    5. — git add -A
    6. — git commit -m “ *** ”
    7. — git pull origin main
    8. — git push origin feature/*

## Installation

Step 1: Create a GitHub repo and clone it to your machine
Step 2: Copy the 02-challenge folder to your cloned GitHub folder
Step 3: Make necessary edits to the HTML and CSS files
Step 4: Be sure to save your changes regularly
Step 5: Push changes to your Githib repo regularly
