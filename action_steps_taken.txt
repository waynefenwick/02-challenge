## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements - <head>, <header>, <body>, <div> - done
     -- Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
     -- Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
     <article>, <aside>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <mark>, <nav>,
     <section>, <summary>, <time>, <figcaption>, <details>
     (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning - done
    --  Structure looks good to me.
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
     -- I did not see any alt attributes
     -- I added alt attributes to each of these elements
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
     -- They are in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
     -- I find the element to be very concise
     -- I do not find the element to be very descriptive.
          -- I do not know who or what "Horiseon" is
          -- seo stands for search engine optimization
          -- In code, it had its own color but was not very clear
          -- I contrasted the color slightly in .css

OTHER ACTION STEPS TAKEN

2. style.css/.benefits: I increased padding by 6px to make bottom of
     Lead Generation box align correctly with bottom of Social Media
     Marketing box.

3. No header section. Top menu scrolled up with the <body>. I added a
     <header> section and moved <class="header"> coding to this section.
     I then set the position to fixed so that the menu options remained
     in view on the screen. Width did not extend all the way accross.
     I added width to this style.css section and set it to 100%.
          -- A top part of the <body> is slightly hidden behind the <header>.
          -- When I add a top margin, it moves the Header down.
          -- Result: when using links, they do not align the page exactly
               right.
