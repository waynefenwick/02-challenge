ACTION STEPS TAKEN
1. In the <body>/<div class=content>, the <id="search..."> value was not entered, resulting in the link not working. I added the <id="search..."> value and problem was resolved.

2. style.css/.benefits: I increased padding by 6px to make bottom of Lead Generation box align correctly with bottom of Social Media Marketing box.

3. No header section. Top menu scrolled up with the <body>. I added a <header> section and moved <class="header"> coding to this section. I then set the position to fixed so that the menu options remained in view on the screen. Width did not extend all the way accross. I added width to this style.css section and set it to 100%. A top part of T
     the <body> is slightly hidden behind the <header>.
